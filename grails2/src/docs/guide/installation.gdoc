h3. Mime Headers
By default, grails prevents browsers from using the accept header. You must tell grails to allow browsers
to do that.

In grails 3, @application.yml@ should do this
{code}
grails:
    mime:
        disable:
            accept:
                header:
                    userAgents: []
{code}

In grails 2, @Config.groovy@ should do this
{code}
grails.mime.disable.accept.header.userAgents = []
{code}

h3. Build Scripts
Given how this codebase is built has changed to accommodate grails 2 as well as 3, if you are using grails 2,
you'll have to add @jcenter@ as a repo and @swaggydoc-commons@ as a lib to your @BuildConfig.groovy@

{code}
repositories {
    ...
    mavenRepo "http://jcenter.bintray.com/"
}
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "com.github.rahulsom:swaggydoc-commons:0.28.1"
}
plugins {
    ...
    compile ":swaggydoc:0.28.1"
}
{code}

In Grails 3, you need to make sure your @build.gradle@ has

{code}
repositories {
    ...
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "org.grails.plugins:swaggydoc-grails3:0.28.0"
}
{code}
